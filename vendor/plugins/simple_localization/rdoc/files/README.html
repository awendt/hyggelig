      <h1>SimpleLocalization Plugin</h1>
<p>
This plugin supports a simple localization for Ruby on Rails and was born
in the first half of 2006 by searching a simple way to localize model and
attribute names of ActiveRecord models. Time after time more and more
features became necessary and the plugin grew. It supports multiple
language localization for Ruby on Rails based on language files, localizes
the <a href="../classes/Date.html">Date</a> and Time classes, many helpers,
some methods of ActiveSupport, the ActiveRecord error messages and provides
two ways to localize models and their attributes. You can also use the
language file to easily localize your own application. You&#8216;ll find an
overview just below.
</p>
<p>
If you have some questions, want to report a bug or just want to talk about
the plugin feel free to visit us at <a
href="http://simple-localization.arkanis.de">simple-localization.arkanis.de</a>/.
</p>
<h2>Overview and key concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy installation and integration.

</li>
<li>Can be easily customized to your needs by turning specific features on and
off.

</li>
<li>Easy to read and write language files using YAML and if needed Ruby, too.

</li>
<li>Can handle multiple languages at runtime.

</li>
<li>Localizes:

<ul>
<li>ActiveRecord model and attribute names (using source code or the language
files)

</li>
<li>ActiveRecord error messages (can contain placeholders for model and
attribute names)

</li>
<li>ActiveRecord helpers

</li>
<li>Number helpers

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Date.html">Date</a> and Time classes and date helpers

</li>
<li>Array extensions (<tt>Array#to_sentence</tt>)

</li>
<li>Country names (just need to be inserted into the language file)

</li>
<li>Templates (eg. <tt>index.de.rhtml</tt>)

</li>
<li>Model attributes (formats and parses numbers and dates as strings e.g. used
in form fields)

</li>
<li>Your application (add your custom entries to the language file)

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A more CSS friendly ActionView <tt>field_error_proc</tt>.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
To make the plugin more felxible and extendable most of the functionality
is split into small &quot;features&quot;. These &quot;features&quot; are
source files located in the <tt>lib/features</tt> directory of the plugin
and each one localizes a small part of Ruby on Rails. When initializing the
plugin you can choose the featurs you want to use. This avoids conflicts in
case you have already localized some parts of your application by other
means.
</p>
<p>
To easily support new languages all language specific strings are extracted
into language files. These language files can be found in the
<tt>languages</tt> directory of the plugin (or <tt>app/languages</tt> for
your own language files) and are written in the YAML format. They also
contain meta data about the author of the language file and can be extended
with Ruby code (eg. configuring the Rails Inflector). More detailed
information or instructions for creating a new language file can be found
in the plugin documenation at <a
href="http://simple-localization.arkanis.de/docs/index">simple-localization.arkanis.de/docs/index</a>.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
You can install the newest version of the plugin (for Rails 1.1 and 1.2)
directly from the SubVersion repository:
</p>
<pre>
  ./script/plugin install http://svn.arkanis-development.de/projects/rails_plugins/current/simple_localization
</pre>
<p>
The next and already last thing is to call the <tt>simple_localization</tt>
method at the end of your <tt>environment.rb</tt> file:
</p>
<pre>
  simple_localization :language =&gt; :de
</pre>
<p>
With this you&#8216;re done. The <tt>:language</tt> parameter lets you
define the language you want to use. Just specify the name of the language
file without the <tt>.yml</tt> extension as a symbol or string. To load
multiple languages just specify them in an array:
</p>
<pre>
  simple_localization :languages =&gt; [:de, :en, :nl, :fr]
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>:languages</tt> and <tt>:language</tt> options are doing exactly
the same. Use whatever sounds best for you. This one call of the
<tt>simple_localization</tt> method gives you quite more control over the
plugin but this is described in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>
<b>Things get a bit complicated when using Rails model observers. Features
which are accessed when the models are loaded are preloaded by the plugin.
To disable a preloaded feature set the
<tt>ArkanisDevelopment::SimpleLocalization::SUPPRESS_FEATURES</tt> constant
to the name (symbol) of the feature. This have to be done before the
<tt>Rails::Initializer.run</tt> call in the <tt>environment.rb</tt>.</b>
This is necessary because an observer (and with it the corresponding model)
is loaded before the plugin is initialized in the <tt>environment.rb</tt>.
Thanks to MK for reporting this problem.

<h2>More information, help, ect.</h2>
<p>
Visit the plugin documentation at <a
href="http://simple-localization.arkanis.de/docs/index">simple-localization.arkanis.de/docs/index</a>.
There is a lot of cool stuff waiting for you there (e.g. multipart language
files, detailed feature descriptions, ect.). You&#8216;ll also find a forum
there so if you have a question don&#8216;t hesitate to ask it.

<dl>
<dt>Mark Kocera</dt><dd>Dutch language file (nl.yml), idea to solve the Rails observer problem.

</dd>
<dt>Sylvain Obegi</dt><dd>French language file (fr.yml), bug hunting, several other good ideas.

</dd>
