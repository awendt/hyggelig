Custom Error Message
====================

This plugin gives you the option to not have your custom validation error message
prefixed with the attribute name. Ordinarily, if you have, say:

    validates_acceptance_of :accepted_terms, :message => 'Please accept the terms of service'

You'll get the following error message:

    Accepted terms Please accept the terms of service

This plugin allows you to omit the attribute name for specific messages. All you have to do
is begin the message with a '^' character. Example:

    validates_acceptance_of :accepted_terms, :message => '^Please accept the terms of service'
    
Nigel Ramsay added the ability to specify a proc to generate the message.

    validates_presence_of :assessment_answer_option_id, 
      :message => Proc.new { |aa| "#{aa.label} (#{aa.group_label}) is required" }

    which gives an error message like: Rate (Accuracy) is required




Detail
------

Redefine the ActiveRecord::Errors::full_messages method:
 Returns all the full error messages in an array. 'Base' messages are handled as usual.
 Non-base messages are prefixed with the attribute name as usual UNLESS 
(1) they begin with '^' in which case the attribute name is omitted.
    E.g. validates_acceptance_of :accepted_terms, :message => '^Please accept the terms of service'
(2) the message is a proc, in which case the proc is invoked on the model object.
    E.g. validates_presence_of :assessment_answer_option_id, 
    :message => Proc.new { |aa| "#{aa.label} (#{aa.group_label}) is required" }
    which gives an error message like:
    Rate (Accuracy) is required
