# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3-ruby (not necessary on OS X Leopard)

# NOTE DEVELOPERS: Support for SQLite is effectively broken with migration 20081227221600.
# Developing on MySQL is now recommended, though you can still use SQLite for development:
# Change migration 20080619163349 to create the responses table with an ID,
# delete migration 20081227221600 and run 'rake RAILS_ENV=development db:migration:reset'.

# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
