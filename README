hyggelig.org is a simple event planning website for you and your friends,
similar to Mobaganda [http://www.mobaganda.com].

This is the free software it runs -- written in Ruby on Rails,
released under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).

hyggelig.org is an attempt to provide the core functionality
of Evite [http://www.evite.com] -- without the bloat and spam, 
but in several languages.

With hyggelig.org, you remain in control:

* no need to register or login
* send out invitations any way you like, using your favorite mailer app
* watch your guests respond through the RSS feed,
  instead of having to visit the event page over and over again
* feel free to contribute -- the project is accepting patches

The source code can be found on http://www.github.com/awendt/hyggelig

NOTE DEVELOPERS: Support for SQLite is effectively broken with migration 20081227221600.
Developing on MySQL is now recommended, though you can still use SQLite for development:
Change migration 20080619163349 to create the responses table with an ID,
delete migration 20081227221600 and run 'rake RAILS_ENV=development db:migration:reset'.
